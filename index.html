    <!-- SECTION 1: What is an affiliate link? -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>1. What is an affiliate link?</h2>
      <p>
        An affiliate link is a normal outbound link to a retailer or brand that contains a small tracking
        parameter. If you click that link and make a purchase within a certain time window, the retailer may
        pay <strong>ronarn AS</strong> a commission for referring the sale.
      </p>
      <p>
        This does not change the price for you. You pay the same as if you had gone directly to the website.
      </p>
      <div class="grid grid-2">
        <div class="card-ghost">
          <h3>What affiliate links do</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Help fund independent reviews and comparison pages.</li>
            <li>Connect clicks on our pages to purchases on partner sites.</li>
            <li>Support ongoing updates, testing and content improvements.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card-ghost">
          <h3>What affiliate links do <em>not</em> do</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Do not allow brands to buy rankings or “top” positions.</li>
            <li>Do not give us access to your full order history.</li>
            <li>Do not change the editorial verdict on any product.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 2: Where we use affiliate links -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>2. Where affiliate links appear in the ronarn network</h2>
      <p>
        Affiliate links are used primarily on <strong>product comparison and recommendation sites</strong>,
        for example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Retynol.com – retinol product comparisons.</li>
        <li>Genectics.com – DNA test kit comparisons.</li>
        <li>AcneHeals.com – acne treatment comparisons.</li>
        <li>Niacinimide.com / Hylaronic.com – ingredient-focused comparisons.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Educational “.bio” sites (like Retinol.bio, TestDNA.bio, Acne.bio, Hyaluronic.bio, Niacinamide.bio)
        are primarily designed as neutral education hubs. Some may link onward to comparison hubs that use
        affiliate links, but they are not designed as “buy now” pages themselves.
      </p>
      <p class="inline-note">
        Each individual site has its own disclosure and privacy pages, which may contain additional,
        context-specific information.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 3: Partner types -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>3. Affiliate programs and partner types we may work with</h2>
      <p>
        The precise mix of affiliate programs can change over time, but typical partner types include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Large online retailers (for example Amazon’s affiliate program).</li>
        <li>Affiliate networks (for example CJ, Impact, Awin or similar platforms).</li>
        <li>Direct brand affiliate programs for specific products or niches.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not list every program by name here because relationships may start and end over time. Wherever
        required, specific partner relationships are disclosed directly on the relevant comparison site or page.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 4: Influence on rankings -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>4. How commissions influence our rankings (they don’t)</h2>
      <p>
        Affiliate commission <strong>does not</strong> determine whether a product is recommended, how it is
        ranked, or whether it appears in a “top list”.
      </p>
      <div class="grid grid-2">
        <div class="card-ghost">
          <h3>What rankings are based on</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Formula quality and ingredient profiles.</li>
            <li>Evidence from clinical studies where available.</li>
            <li>Price-to-value ratio and availability.</li>
            <li>Real-world user experience patterns.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card-ghost">
          <h3>What rankings are <em>not</em> based on</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Which brand pays the highest commission.</li>
            <li>Private deals to “boost” a product.</li>
            <li>Sponsored placements disguised as editorial content.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="inline-note">

    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 5: Criteria for accepting partners -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>5. Criteria for accepting affiliate partners</h2>
      <p>
        We do not automatically accept every possible affiliate offer. Typical criteria include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reasonable trust and reputation in the market.</li>
        <li>Clear and accessible return/refund policies.</li>
        <li>Secure checkout and payment handling.</li>
        <li>Product categories that match our editorial focus.</li>
        <li>Respect for local laws, regulations and safety standards.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If we no longer believe a partner meets these basic expectations, we may remove or replace links over time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 6: Your choices -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>6. Your choices and how to avoid affiliate tracking</h2>
      <p>
        You are always free to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visit a retailer or brand website directly without using our links.</li>
        <li>Use tracker-blocking tools or privacy features in your browser.</li>
        <li>Decline non-essential cookies where applicable on individual sites.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our goal is to make it clear when a link may be an affiliate link and to ensure you never pay more
        because you chose to support our work.
